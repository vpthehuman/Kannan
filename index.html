            <p>Mr. Kannan is great. He gets annoyed when you do not ask permission from him to extend your vacation. But it's ok, he is the dad.</p>
            <p>He showed denial consistently when I told mom I had a taste of alcohol because he is the father. Usually, he is introverted, especially during fights with his wife.</p>
            <p>He thinks he can lure me back with puddings and food when I'm upset (he is right), but no, no, no, not okay.</p>
